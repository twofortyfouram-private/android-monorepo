/**
 * Perform a series of {@link ContentProviderOperation}s in a background thread.
 * The primary use case is to simplify improving UI performance. For example,
 * when the user hits the back button in an Activity that wants to save some
 * data. Rather than blocking the Activity (which is necessary to ensure the
 * process has enough priority to complete the save to disk), this service
 * provides an alternative way to raise the process's priority without blocking
 * the main thread for the disk write.
 * <p>
 * Clients must subclass and implement a concrete implementation.  This allows clients
 * have control over the process that the service runs in.
 * </p>
 * <p>This class is not intended to be a public interface for other processes, but rather an
 * internal interface within an application.  As public interface, clients could crash the
 * service by putting incorrect types into the extras.</p>
