/**
 * <p>Abstract superclass for a plug-in setting BroadcastReceiver implementation.</p>
 * <p>The plug-in receiver lifecycle is as follows:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #onReceive(Context, Intent)} is called by the Android
 * frameworks.
 * onReceive() will verify that the Intent is valid.  If the Intent is invalid, the receiver
 * returns
 * immediately.  If the Intent appears to be valid, then the lifecycle continues.</li>
 * <li>{@link #isJsonValid(JSONObject)} is called to determine whether {@link
 * LocalePluginIntent#EXTRA_BUNDLE EXTRA_BUNDLE} is valid. If the Bundle is
 * invalid, then the
 * receiver returns immediately.  If the bundle is valid, then the lifecycle continues.</li>
 * <li>{@link #isAsync()} is called to determine whether the remaining work should be performed on
 * a
 * background thread.</li>
 * <li>{@link #firePluginSetting(Context, JSONObject)} is called to trigger
 * the plug-in setting's action.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this BroadcastReceiver must be registered in the Android
 * Manifest with an Intent filter for
 * {@link LocalePluginIntent#ACTION_FIRE_SETTING ACTION_FIRE_SETTING}. The
 * BroadcastReceiver must be exported, enabled, and cannot have permissions
 * enforced on it.
